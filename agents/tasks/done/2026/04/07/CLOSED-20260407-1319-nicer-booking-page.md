## Closing summary (TOP)

- **What happened:** The public booking page hero was updated for readability over header images and the restaurant website was exposed as a proper external link (issue #173).
- **What was done:** SCSS frosted panel and title shadows on `book` hero; `websiteHref` / `websiteLinkText` in the component; template anchor with accessibility and new-tab behavior per task notes.
- **What was tested:** Tester verified hero styling, website link, keyboard focus, and `test:landing-version` — overall **PASS** (optional public debug script failed on seating-area precondition only).
- **Why closed:** All stated acceptance criteria met; tester signed off with no blocking issues for this scope.

# Nicer booking page

## GitHub Issues
- [github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues](https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues)
- `gh issue list --repo satisfecho/pos --state open --limit 40`
- Optional: `--json number,title,labels,updatedAt,url`
- **Issue:** https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues/173

## Problem / goal
Improve the public booking page (example tenant URL in issue: `/book/1081` on local dev). **Readability:** the `hero-content` area should use styling (background, rounded corners, padding/margins) so text stays readable over the existing background image—keep the image, improve contrast and legibility. **Links:** when the restaurant has a website URL configured, expose it as a normal clickable link in the UI.

## High-level instructions for coder
- Locate the booking page component/template and styles for the hero section; align with existing design tokens and `front/public/i18n` for any new strings.
- Implement a readable overlay or panel for hero text (background, radius, spacing) without removing the background image.
- Wire the restaurant website field so it renders as a proper anchor (`href`, accessibility, open behavior per product norms).
- Smoke-test the public booking flow for at least one tenant; verify responsive layout.

## Implementation summary
- **`front/src/app/book/book.component.scss`:** Stronger frosted panel (blur, inset highlight, darker rgba with `has-bg-image`), horizontal padding on `.hero-content`, text shadow on title/tagline when a header image is present.
- **`front/src/app/book/book.component.ts`:** `websiteHref` (adds `https://` when no scheme), `websiteLinkText` (hostname without `www`, else `BOOK.WEBSITE`).
- **`front/src/app/book/book.component.html`:** Website anchor uses computeds, `title` = full href, small external-link SVG, `rel="noopener noreferrer"` + `target="_blank"` unchanged.

## Testing instructions
1. Sync **`development`**; ensure stack is up (`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps`); app on **`http://127.0.0.1:4202`** (HAProxy).
2. Open a public booking page for a tenant with a **header background image** and **website** set in settings (e.g. **`/book/{tenantId}`**). Confirm hero text is readable (panel + shadows on busy image).
3. Confirm **website** link: visible **hostname** as text, **opens in new tab**, tooltip shows full URL; if settings store URL without `https://`, link still works.
4. Keyboard: tab to website link — **focus ring** visible.
5. Regression: `cd front && BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 npm run test:landing-version` (pass).
6. Optional: `node front/scripts/debug-reservations-public.mjs` with `BASE_URL` if public flow smoke is required.

## Test report

**Date/time (UTC):** 2026-04-07 — verification window approximately **13:48–13:52 UTC** (landing test started 13:48:50Z; browser checks immediately after).

**Log window:** `docker compose … logs --tail=25 front` (build success lines around 13:44Z UTC from prior session activity; no errors during verification window).

**Environment:** `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.dev.yml`; **`BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202`**; branch **`development`** @ **`40b34fe`**.

**What was tested:** (from Testing instructions) Hero readability with header image; website link behavior; keyboard focus; regression `test:landing-version`; optional public script.

**Results:**

1. Stack reachable (HAProxy): **PASS** — `docker compose … ps` shows `haproxy` `0.0.0.0:4202->4202/tcp`, `front`/`back` up.
2. Hero + header image (tenant **1**, `/book/1`): **PASS** — `.hero-header.has-bg-image`; `.hero-content-panel` computed: `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`, `background: rgba(0,0,0,0.58)`, `border-radius: 16px`, inset/box shadows; `h1` has text shadow for legibility.
3. Website link: **PASS** — Link text **iceodev.com** (hostname); `href=https://iceodev.com/`, `target=_blank`, `rel=noopener noreferrer`, `title` = full URL. API: `GET /api/public/tenants/1` includes `website` and `header_background_filename`.
4. URL without `https://` in settings: **PASS (indirect)** — No tenant in local DB had a bare website string to exercise end-to-end; implementation uses `websiteHref` to prefix `https://` when no scheme (per task summary). Full-URL case verified live.
5. Keyboard focus on website link: **PASS** — After `focus()`, `outline: solid 2px rgba(255,255,255,0.95)` visible.
6. Regression `npm run test:landing-version`: **PASS** — exit code **0** (`>>> RESULT: Landing version OK…`, elapsed ~44s).
7. Optional `debug-reservations-public.mjs`: **FAIL (script preconditions, not hero/website)** — Submit blocked with “Please choose a seating area.” (tenant has multiple book zones); does not indicate a defect in hero/website work.

**Overall:** **PASS**

**Product owner feedback:** The public booking hero for tenant 1 reads clearly over the photo thanks to the frosted panel and title shadow, and the restaurant site is an obvious external link with hostname, tooltip, and new-tab behavior. No blocking issues found for this scope.

**URLs tested:**

1. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/` (landing test)
2. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/dashboard` and other staff routes (via landing test sidebar)
3. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/book/1` (manual/DevTools verification)
