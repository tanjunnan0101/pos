## Closing summary (TOP)

- **What happened:** GitHub issue #23 asked for payment before checkout so staff can record payment while an order is still in progress, not only at a single checkout moment.
- **What was done:** Backend `mark-paid` already allowed pre-completion payment; the staff orders UI added **Pay now** on active/unpaid cards (with permission), a modal with **`ORDERS.PAY_NOW_HELP`**, and pytest coverage in `test_order_prepay.py` for line items staying **preparing** after early pay.
- **What was tested:** Pytest `test_order_prepay.py`, front build log check, `npm run test:landing-version`, manual/Puppeteer pay-early, and finish API smoke — all **PASS** per the test report.
- **Why closed:** Tester **overall PASS**; all stated pass/fail criteria met.

# Pay before checkout

## GitHub
- **Issue:** https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues/23

## Problem / goal
Some customers want to pay before food is fully prepared. Orders must support **taking payment at any appropriate point** in the flow, not only at a single “checkout” moment.

## High-level instructions for coder
- Map the current order lifecycle (states, kitchen, payment, mark-paid/finish) in backend and staff UI; read payment-related docs if present.
- Define allowed transitions: e.g. pay while order is still open/in progress, and how that affects kitchen and customer-facing views.
- Implement API and UI changes so staff can record payment early without breaking existing flows; keep invariants for totals, tips, and invoices.
- Add tests covering pay-early vs pay-at-end scenarios and regression for normal checkout.

## Coder notes
- **Backend:** `PUT /orders/{id}/mark-paid` already allows pre-payment while items are not delivered (see comment in `main.py`). `PUT /orders/{id}/finish` still marks all active lines delivered and then pays (fast checkout).
- **Frontend:** **Pay now** is shown on **Active** and **Not paid yet** order cards for users with `order:mark_paid` (secondary when **Finish** is also shown; primary when the user only has mark-paid). The payment modal shows **`ORDERS.PAY_NOW_HELP`** when not in finish mode.
- **Test:** `back/tests/test_order_prepay.py` — mark-paid on a **preparing** order leaves line items **preparing**.

## Testing instructions

### What to verify
- Staff can open **Pay now** from an unpaid order card, complete the payment modal, and the order becomes **paid** while kitchen line statuses are unchanged.
- **Finish** still delivers all lines and pays in one step.
- API regression: mark-paid accepted before all items are served.

### How to test
1. **Backend:** With stack up,  
   `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec back python3 -m pytest tests/test_order_prepay.py -v`
2. **Frontend build:**  
   `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --tail=80 front` — no TS/Angular errors after changes.
3. **Smoke:** From `front/`,  
   `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 npm run test:landing-version`  
   (requires app on 4202 and optional `.env` demo login for full nav).
4. **Manual:** Log in as a user with **mark paid**; open **Orders** → **Active** or **Not paid yet**; confirm **Pay now** appears next to **Finish** (if applicable); pay a non-completed order and confirm status **Paid** and items still on prior kitchen status.

### Pass/fail criteria
- **Pass:** Pytest prepay test green; front build clean; smoke test exit 0; manual pay-early flow works.
- **Fail:** Any of the above fails or mark-paid incorrectly changes line items before finish.

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC)** and log window  
   - **2026-03-23 15:52–15:57 UTC** (pytest, smoke, UI automation, finish API smoke, log checks).

2. **Environment**  
   - **Compose:** `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.dev.yml`  
   - **BASE_URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:4202` (HAProxy)  
   - **Branch / commit:** `development` @ `e6b35c2`

3. **What was tested** (from “What to verify” + pass/fail criteria)  
   - Staff **Pay now** → payment modal → confirm **mark paid** on an unpaid **preparing** order; order **Paid**, line items unchanged (still **preparing**).  
   - **Finish** path: deliver all lines + pay in one step (API smoke).  
   - **API regression:** mark-paid before all items served (pytest).  
   - Frontend build health (recent logs), landing smoke.

4. **Results**

   | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
   |-----------|--------|----------|
   | Pytest `test_order_prepay.py` | **PASS** | `1 passed in 0.87s` |
   | Front build (no TS/Angular errors in recent window) | **PASS** | `docker compose … logs --since 45m front \| grep -iE '\\[ERROR\]|TS[0-9]+'` → no matches; prior tail ends with `Application bundle generation complete` |
   | Smoke `npm run test:landing-version` | **PASS** | `exit_code: 0`, demo login + sidebar OK |
   | Manual pay-early (UI) | **PASS** | Puppeteer (local one-off): `#order-card-431` → **Pay now** → modal shows pay-now help (kitchen hint) → primary confirm → card badge **Paid**; DB: order **paid**, item **preparing** |
   | Finish still delivers + pays | **PASS** | In-container `PUT /orders/{id}/finish` on fresh test order **433**: response `status: paid`; DB item **delivered** |
   | mark-paid does not advance line items before finish | **PASS** | Matches pytest + post–mark-paid DB check on order **431** |

5. **Overall:** **PASS**

6. **Product owner feedback**  
   Early payment from the staff orders list behaves as intended: the modal explains that kitchen status is preserved, and after marking paid the order shows **Paid** while line items remain in **preparing** until served or **Finish** is used elsewhere. **Finish** still moves active lines to **delivered** and records payment in one API call.

7. **URLs tested**  
   1. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/login?tenant=1`  
   2. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/dashboard` (post-login)  
   3. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/staff/orders` (Pay now + modal + confirm)

8. **Relevant log excerpts**  
   - **back:** `INFO: … "PUT /orders/431/mark-paid HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`  
   - **front (recent window):** no `[ERROR]` / TS lines in last 45 minutes of captured logs.

**Tester notes**  
- **GitHub:** `gh issue comment 23` failed with `Resource not accessible by personal access token`; labels not updated from this environment.  
- **Data:** For UI proof, order **431** was completed in DB with a **preparing** line (tenant 1) where the list had no suitable card initially; then **mark paid** was executed via UI. Order **433** was created only for **finish** API smoke.  
- **Automation:** One-off Puppeteer script lived under `/tmp/pay-now-check.mjs` (not committed); uses `.env` demo credentials like `test-landing-version.mjs`.
