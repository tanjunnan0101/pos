# Nice the landing page

## GitHub
- **Issue:** https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues/69

## Problem / goal
The public landing at `http://127.0.0.1:4202/` (and production) should feel polished and welcoming for both restaurant owners and restaurant clients. The reporter pointed at a reference layout (wz-it “AnythingLLM” page) as inspiration: research strong landing patterns, then evolve our landing toward a clearer, more beautiful experience without abandoning existing design tokens and i18n expectations. Prior closed tasks archived implementation and verification notes; treat this queue item as the feature-coder path until the issue is closed on GitHub.

## High-level instructions for coder
- Re-read issue body and any `agents/tasks/done/**/CLOSED-*nice-the-landing-page*.md` for what was already shipped vs what might still be open.
- Compare current `/` against the issue’s acceptance: hero, owner vs guest paths, mobile-first layout, accessibility, and `LANDING.*` (or equivalent) strings across `front/public/i18n/*.json`.
- If gaps remain, implement minimal, cohesive UI changes aligned with existing Angular patterns; run frontend build/smoke as in `AGENTS.md`.
- If work is complete, hand evidence to closer / maintainer to close **#69** on GitHub (or post a short verification comment).

## Coder notes (2026-03-24, feature-coder pickup)
- **Prior work:** `agents/tasks/done/2026/03/24/CLOSED-20260324-1817-nice-the-landing-page.md` and `CLOSED-20260324-1842-nice-the-landing-page.md` document the refreshed `LandingComponent` (hero, value props, guest/staff panels, restaurants block, footer provider links with i18n) and tester **PASS**.
- **This run:** No additional product code changes required. Re-verified current tree matches that scope.
- **i18n:** All seven files under `front/public/i18n/*.json` share the same 27 `LANDING.*` keys (parity script: OK).
- **GitHub #69:** Still **open** (body: polish landing for owners/clients; reference URL). Implementation aligns with intent; **maintainer/closer** should close **#69** or comment after tester PASS (token scope may block automated `gh issue comment`, per archived notes).
- **Smoke (local Docker, ~2026-03-24T18:58–18:59Z):** `curl` → `200` on `/`; `test-landing-provider-links.mjs` exit `0`; `test-landing-version.mjs` exit `0`; `docker compose … logs --tail=80 front` shows successful bundle generation, no TS/NG errors in tail.

## Testing instructions

### What to verify
- `/` loads; hero, value row, guest panel (table code + takeaway link), staff panel (register CTA), restaurants section (or empty state), footer (including translated provider links), version bar.
- No raw `LANDING.*` keys in UI when switching language (e.g. DE).
- `data-testid="landing-provider-login"`, `landing-provider-register`, `landing-staff-register`, `landing-version` still present where applicable.

### How to test
- Stack: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml` (or existing dev stack); `http://127.0.0.1:4202/`.
- `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --tail=80 front` — no Angular/TS build errors.
- From `front/`: `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 node scripts/test-landing-provider-links.mjs`
- From `front/`: `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 node scripts/test-landing-version.mjs` (optional: `.env` / `LOGIN_*` for extended nav).
- Manual: narrow + wide viewport; language picker → non-English locale.

### Pass / fail criteria
- **Pass:** Both scripts exit `0`; build log clean; footer and hero strings localized (no exposed keys); no layout regression on `/`.
- **Fail:** Non-zero script exit, build errors, missing i18n keys, or broken table lookup / tenant cards / footer routes.

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC):** 2026-03-24 — verification started ~19:00Z, completed ~19:03Z. Log window: `docker compose … logs --tail=80/200 front` immediately after runs (~19:01–19:03Z).

2. **Environment:** `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.dev.yml`; `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202`; branch `development` @ `a6317bc`; services up (haproxy 4202, pos-front, pos-back, db).

3. **What was tested:** Per **What to verify** and **How to test**: `/` load; Puppeteer landing scripts; front build log sanity; German locale (no exposed i18n keys); required `data-testid` attributes; narrow (375×812) + wide (1440×900) viewport spot-checks.

4. **Results**
   - `/` returns HTTP 200 — **PASS** — `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"` → `200`.
   - `test-landing-provider-links.mjs` — **PASS** — exit `0`; provider login/register links OK; navigates to `/provider/register` successfully.
   - `test-landing-version.mjs` — **PASS** — exit `0`; `landing-version` text present; extended nav completed.
   - Front container logs (tail 80 + grep tail 200) — **PASS** — `Application bundle generation complete`; no `error` / `TS####` / `NG####` / `failed` matches in tail=200.
   - DE locale: no raw `LANDING.` in visible body text — **PASS** — Puppeteer: `page.select('.language-select','de')` then `!document.body.innerText.includes('LANDING.')`.
   - `data-testid` — **PASS** — `landing-provider-login`, `landing-provider-register`, `landing-staff-register`, `landing-version` all found on `/` after DE switch.
   - Layout / hero — **PASS** — narrow DE check + wide EN hero title non-empty and not a raw key (`Your restaurant, connected`).

5. **Overall:** **PASS**

6. **Product owner feedback:** The public landing responds quickly and the automated checks confirm provider footer links, version bar, and staff register hook remain intact. German strings render without leaking translation keys, which keeps the experience trustworthy for non-English users. Ready for closer to align GitHub **#69** (open/close) with product intent.

7. **URLs tested**
   1. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/`
   2. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/provider/register` (from provider-links script)
   3. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/dashboard` … `http://127.0.0.1:4202/settings` (sidebar nav from `test-landing-version.mjs`)

8. **Relevant log excerpts**
   - `pos-front` (tail): `Application bundle generation complete. [0.007 seconds] - 2026-03-24T18:44:32.846Z` (and similar successful rebuild lines); no errors in sampled window.
   - Puppeteer (provider links): `>>> RESULT: Landing shows provider login and register links; register link works.`
   - Puppeteer (version): `>>> RESULT: Landing version OK; demo login (tenant=1) OK; sidebar nav OK.`
