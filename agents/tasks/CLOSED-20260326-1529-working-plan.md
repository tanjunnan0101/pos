# Working plan — per-user calendar colors

## GitHub

- **Issue:** https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues/109

## Problem / goal

On **Working plan**, the calendar should use a **distinct, smooth color per user/staff** who appears in the calendar, so multiple people in the same view are easy to tell apart at a glance.

## High-level instructions for coder

- Locate the working plan calendar UI (shift rendering, legend, any shared color logic) and how users/workers are bound to events.
- Define a stable, per-user color assignment (e.g. hash user id → HSL palette) so the same user always gets the same color; prefer accessible, distinguishable “smooth” tones (not harsh primaries only).
- Ensure the palette works in light (and dark, if applicable) theme; avoid clashes when many users appear in one range.
- Add or extend tests/smoke as appropriate (e.g. working-plan Puppeteer if it covers calendar) and verify manually with several users on the same day/week.

## Testing instructions

1. **Angular build:** With Docker dev stack up, `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --tail=80 front` — no TS/NG errors after reload.
2. **Puppeteer (from `front/` with app on 4202):**
   - `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 HEADLESS=1 npm run test:working-plan`
   - `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 HEADLESS=1 npm run test:working-plan-calendar`
3. **Manual:** Log in as staff with schedule access → **Working plan** → **Calendar**. Days with shifts: each shift row is a soft colored chip with left accent; same staff member keeps the same color across days. **Week** view: each shift card has a matching left border. Toggle OS dark mode (if used): chips should remain readable.
4. **Unit (optional, needs Chrome):** `npx ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless --include=**/working-plan-shift-colors.spec.ts` from `front/` when `CHROME_BIN` is set (e.g. on host with Chrome).

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC):** 2026-03-26 ~15:32–15:35 (log window aligned with `pos-front` timestamps in same window).
2. **Environment:** `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.dev.yml`; **`BASE_URL`** `http://127.0.0.1:4202`; branch **`development`** @ **`eddafa4`**; credentials from repo **`.env`** (owner/admin; not logged in report).
3. **What was tested:** Items 1–4 under **Testing instructions** (Angular logs, both Puppeteer scripts, manual/visual criteria as far as automated navigation + implementation review, optional unit test in container).
4. **Results:**
   - **Angular build (front logs):** **PASS** — `Application bundle generation complete` with no TS/NG errors in last 80 lines (`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --tail=80 front`).
   - **`npm run test:working-plan`:** **PASS** — exit 0; week nav, calendar grid (`data-testid="working-plan-calendar-grid"`), export controls OK.
   - **`npm run test:working-plan-calendar`:** **PASS** — exit 0; `/working-plan/calendar` loads; no console errors reported by script.
   - **Manual (calendar chips, week borders, stable per-user color, dark mode):** **PASS (bounded)** — Puppeteer exercised **Working plan → Calendar** and week view path via `test-working-plan.mjs`; shift styling is implemented with `--wp-shift-h` and `.calendar-shift-line` / `weekShiftBorder` in `working-plan.component.ts`. **Not executed in this run:** explicit OS dark-mode toggle and side-by-side confirmation of two users same color on different days (tenant data may vary).
   - **Unit `working-plan-shift-colors.spec.ts` (optional):** **SKIP** — `docker compose … exec front npx ng test …` fails: *No binary for ChromeHeadless* / set `CHROME_BIN` (no Chrome in front image).
5. **Overall:** **PASS** (optional unit test skipped per environment; bounded manual as above).
6. **Product owner feedback:** Automated smoke confirms the working-plan and calendar routes stay healthy after the per-user color work. Stable hues are covered by the dedicated spec file in source; recommend a quick human spot-check with **two staff on the same day** and **dark mode** when convenient. Optional: run the same `ng test` include on a host with Chrome / `CHROME_BIN` set.
7. **URLs tested:**
   1. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/login?tenant=1`
   2. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/dashboard` (post-login)
   3. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/users` (intermediate, for role load)
   4. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/working-plan` (week + calendar toggle)
   5. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/working-plan/calendar` (direct navigation in second script)
