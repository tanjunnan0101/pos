## Problem / goal
When the floor plan loads (and when switching floor/area tabs), the full set of tables should be visible, centered in the viewport with comfortable padding—not stuck in a corner or flush to an edge. Match typical “fit to content” / “zoom to fit” canvas behavior.

If there are no tables, define an explicit default (e.g. centered empty canvas, scale 1). Optional: any existing “Reset view” control should reuse the same fit/center logic. Clarify whether switching floors re-fits the view (recommended: yes). Do not disrupt manual pan/zoom during a session unless the user resets or navigates away.

See **`docs/testing.md`** for tables canvas smoke scripts (e.g. `test-tables-canvas-view-options`) after changes.

## High-level instructions for coder
- Locate the tables canvas / floor plan component and how pan/zoom (or SVG/viewBox transforms) are applied today.
- On initial render for a floor and when the active floor/area changes, compute a bounding box over all table elements for that view.
- Adjust pan and zoom (or equivalent) so that bounding box is centered with a margin; avoid edge-clipping.
- Handle empty floors explicitly; align “Reset view” with the same logic if it exists.
- Smoke the floor plan after edits (switch floors, pan/zoom, ensure no regressions to drag/join flows documented in recent tables canvas work).

## Implementation summary (coder)
- **`front/src/app/tables/tables-canvas.component.ts`:** `fitViewToCurrentFloorTables()` computes an axis-aligned bounding box from existing `tableCanvasBounds`, applies padding (`viewFitPadding` 48px), sets `zoomLevel` (clamped to min/max) and `panOffset` so the content center matches the canvas center. Empty floor → `zoomLevel = 1`, `panOffset = {0,0}`.
- **Initial load:** `tryInitialViewFit()` runs once after both a tables API snapshot (`tablesSnapshotReceived`) and floors + `selectedFloorId` are ready — does **not** run on every `loadData()` refresh (join/layout reloads keep user pan/zoom).
- **Floor switch / new floor / after delete floor:** `fitViewToCurrentFloorTables()` after selection changes.
- **Reset control:** `resetZoom()` now calls `fitViewToCurrentFloorTables()` (same as fit/center).

## Testing instructions (for tester)
1. **Stack:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml` with app on HAProxy (e.g. `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202`).
2. **Automated:** From `front/`: `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 HEADLESS=1 npm run test:tables-canvas-view-options` — exit 0. Also `npm run test:landing-version` — exit 0.
3. **Manual /tables/canvas:** Open floor plan with multiple tables — all should be visible with margin on first load. Switch floor tabs — view should re-fit to that floor’s tables. Empty floor — full canvas at 100% with no odd offset. Pan/zoom, then use reset — should snap to fit. Reload data without changing floor (e.g. after operations that call `loadData`) — pan/zoom should **not** reset unexpectedly.

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC) and log window:** 2026-04-07 ~12:17–12:23 UTC. Evidence drawn from `docker compose … logs --since 30m front` and command output from the same window.

2. **Environment:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml` (HAProxy `0.0.0.0:4202->4202`). **`BASE_URL`:** `http://127.0.0.1:4202`. **Branch:** `development` @ `b1c3f12`.

3. **What was tested:** Per **Testing instructions**: automated `test:tables-canvas-view-options` and `test:landing-version`; manual checks for table bounding boxes inside the floor SVG after load, after switching to the second floor tab (tenant 1 has 2 floors), and after zoom-in ×2 then **Reset zoom** (third control in `.zoom-controls`).

4. **Results:**
   - **Automated `test:tables-canvas-view-options`:** **PASS** — exit 0; Floor plan → Tiles → Table → Floor plan → Table flow completed.
   - **Automated `test:landing-version`:** **PASS** — exit 0; landing footer version OK, login tenant=1, sidebar nav + inventory sublinks OK.
   - **First load — all tables visible with margin in SVG:** **PASS** — Puppeteer: 10 `g.table-group` nodes on first floor; union bbox inside `svg.canvas-svg` rect with relaxed margin check (`marginOk: true`).
   - **Floor tab switch — re-fit:** **PASS** — second floor tab selected; 3 tables on that floor; `ok`/`marginOk` true after switch.
   - **Zoom in then Reset (fit/center):** **PASS** — after two zoom-in clicks, reset restores fit (`ok`/`marginOk` true, 3 tables on active floor).
   - **Empty floor:** **N/A** — not exercised (no empty floor in this tenant during the run).
   - **`loadData()` refresh without floor change — pan/zoom preserved:** **N/A** — not exercised (would need a targeted operation that calls `loadData` while observing pan/zoom); implementation note in task: `tryInitialViewFit()` is once-only after snapshot + floors, not on every refresh.

5. **Overall:** **PASS** (all exercised criteria passed; two manual scenarios left **N/A** as above).

6. **Product owner feedback:** The floor plan now keeps the active floor’s tables framed in the canvas with padding on first paint, after changing floors, and after using reset. Automated navigation smoke tests and extra bounding-box checks did not show clipping or corner-stuck layouts. Follow-up: if issues appear on **empty floors** or **silent data reloads**, add a focused Puppeteer case or manual script for those paths.
