# Feedback page needs translation

## GitHub

- **Issue:** https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues/67

## Problem / goal

Public guest feedback URL (e.g. production-style `https://satisfecho.de/feedback/1?token=…`) still shows parts of the form or page that are not in the user-selected language. Acceptance: every guest-visible part of the feedback flow is translated; no raw `FEEDBACK.*` keys or wrong-language copy. See `front/src/app/feedback-public/`, `front/public/i18n/`, and `front/scripts/test-feedback-public-i18n.mjs` for prior verification work documented in `agents/tasks/done/`.

## High-level instructions for coder

- Reproduce locally on Docker (`/feedback/{tenant}` with and without valid `?token=`) and compare every locale in the language picker plus default detection.
- Fix any remaining untranslated template strings, API error messages, document title, or loading/empty states; keep parity across locale JSON files.
- Run or extend the feedback-public i18n Puppeteer script; note any production-only gaps for the closer.
