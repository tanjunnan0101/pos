# Email message of reservation need information

## GitHub
- **Issue:** https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/issues/91

## Problem / goal
Reservation emails sent via SMTP should include more useful guest-facing information, specifically a **link to the reservation** (e.g. manage/view flow) and a **contact phone number** (restaurant or relevant contact), so messages are actionable without hunting elsewhere.

## High-level instructions for coder
- Locate reservation email templates and send path (backend); identify what data is already available on the reservation / tenant (public booking URL pattern, tenant phone, etc.).
- Add reservation link and contact number to the email body (and plain-text part if applicable) with sensible fallbacks when a field is missing.
- Keep content translatable or consistent with existing i18n for transactional mail if the project already localizes those messages.
- Smoke-test send path in dev (or log preview) without using `example.com` for real send tests per project rules; align with `docs/` if any reservation/email docs exist.

## Implementation notes (coder)
- **Confirmation:** `back/app/reservation_email_template.py` — default body includes `{{restaurant_contact_block_html}}` after the manage-reservation link. New allowlisted placeholder `restaurant_contact_block_html`: plain part = “Contact us:” + phone/email lines; HTML = `<p>` with `tel:` / `mailto:` links. Empty when tenant has neither `phone` nor `email`. `restaurant_phone` / `restaurant_email` remain available for custom templates.
- **Reminder:** `back/app/email_service.py` `send_reservation_reminder` appends the same contact block (HTML + plain) when `tenant` is passed and contact fields exist.
- **Settings UI:** `RESERVATION_CONFIRMATION_BODY_HINT` updated in all `front/public/i18n/*.json` locales to document the new placeholder.

## Testing instructions
1. **Backend unit tests** (from repo root, stack up or image built):  
   `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T back python -m pytest tests/test_reservation_email_template.py tests/test_reservation_reminder_email.py -q`  
   Expect: all passed.
2. **Integration (optional):** With valid SMTP and `PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL` in `config.env`, create a reservation with a real test recipient email and tenant **phone** + **email** set in Settings → Contact. Confirm the received message (HTML + plain) shows the manage link and a “Contact us” section with phone and email.
3. **Reminder:** From staff reservations, use **Send reminder** for a booking with customer email; body should include the contact block when tenant phone/email are set (same as confirmation formatting).
4. **UI copy:** Settings → Reservations → reservation confirmation body hint should mention `restaurant_contact_block_html` in the active UI language.

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC) and log window:** 2026-03-25 13:44–13:45 UTC; backend pytest in `pos-back`.
2. **Environment:** `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.dev.yml`; branch `development` @ `ec88ef5`.
3. **What was tested:** Items 1–4 under **Testing instructions** (unit tests; optional SMTP receive skipped; reminder send skipped in browser; i18n hint strings in repo).
4. **Results:**
   - **(1) Backend unit tests** — **PASS** — `8 passed in 0.24s` for `test_reservation_email_template.py` + `test_reservation_reminder_email.py`.
   - **(2) Integration (optional)** — **N/A** — No live SMTP inbox verification in this run (not required as “optional” in task).
   - **(3) Reminder (manual staff flow)** — **PASS (by automated tests)** — Not re-sent via UI; `test_reservation_reminder_email.py` exercises reminder formatting path per implementation notes.
   - **(4) UI copy / i18n hint** — **PASS** — `RESERVATION_CONFIRMATION_BODY_HINT` includes `restaurant_contact_block_html` in `en`, `es`, `de`, `fr`, `ca`, `zh-CN`, `hi` under `front/public/i18n/`.
5. **Overall:** **PASS**
6. **Product owner feedback:** Backend tests and locale files confirm the new contact placeholder is wired and documented. For full confidence on real mail rendering, send one confirmation and one reminder through your SMTP to a real inbox when convenient.
7. **URLs tested:** **N/A — no browser** (i18n verified in source files).
8. **Relevant log excerpts:**
   - `pytest`: `8 passed in 0.24s` (`tests/test_reservation_email_template.py`, `tests/test_reservation_reminder_email.py`).

**Note:** `agent:testing` label not present on repo; start comment posted on issue #91.
