## Closing summary (TOP)

- **What happened:** Issue #83 reported that in Settings → Security the 2FA control sat flush against the explanatory text with insufficient vertical separation.
- **What was done:** Scoped CSS added margin below the OTP hint paragraph in the security section so copy is separated from the primary **Enable two-factor authentication** button (and setup-flow hints), aligned with existing spacing patterns.
- **What was tested:** Tester **PASS** — measured 16px margin-bottom and gap to the primary button; `test:landing-version` exit 0; front build clean in logs.
- **Why closed:** Test report overall **PASS**; acceptance criteria met; no regressions noted on the smoke path.

# Two factor authentication button decoration

## GitHub

- **Issue:** https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/issues/83

## Problem / goal

In **Settings → Security**, the two-factor authentication control sits flush against the text above. Add spacing (e.g. margin-top) so the button is visually separated from the preceding copy, consistent with other settings sections.

## High-level instructions for coder

- Locate the security / 2FA settings template and styles (Angular).
- Add layout spacing between the explanatory text block and the 2FA action button without breaking responsive layouts.
- Verify in the UI that spacing matches nearby settings cards and accessibility (focus order unchanged).

## Implementation summary

- Scoped style on `[data-testid='settings-security-section'] .form-card > p.hint` with `margin-bottom: var(--space-4)` so OTP explanatory copy (and the setup-flow hint before the secret row) is separated from the following control, aligned with `.otp-enabled-msg` spacing.

## Testing instructions

1. Log in as a user who can open **Settings** (e.g. demo staff).
2. Open **Settings → Security** (`data-testid="settings-security-section"`).
3. When OTP is **not** enabled: confirm clear vertical space between the description paragraph and **Enable two-factor authentication** (primary button).
4. Start setup (if testing further): confirm space between the “add to app” hint and the secret/QR row.
5. Optional: `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 npm run test:landing-version --prefix front` (includes navigating to `/settings`).

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC):** 2026-03-25T11:22Z – 2026-03-25T11:35Z (approx.). **Log window:** same (front container tail after runs).

2. **Environment:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml`; **BASE_URL** `http://127.0.0.1:4202`; branch **development**.

3. **What was tested:** Settings → Security layout when OTP is not enabled (hint vs primary button); optional landing smoke including `/settings`; front build health via container logs.

4. **Results:**
   - Clear vertical space between OTP description and **Enable two-factor authentication** (primary): **PASS** — Puppeteer measured `getComputedStyle` on `[data-testid="settings-security-section"] .form-card > p.hint`: `margin-bottom: 16px`; gap from hint bottom to primary button top **16px** (evidence: script output `{"marginBottom":"16px","gapPx":16}`).
   - Space between “add to app” hint and secret row (setup flow): **PASS (by implementation)** — same scoped rule targets `.form-card > p.hint` in setup state; **not** re-run interactively (optional in instructions).
   - `test:landing-version` with login: **PASS** — exit 0; navigated including `/settings`.
   - No new front build errors: **PASS** — `docker compose … logs --tail=40 front` shows successful bundle generation, no TS/template errors in window.

5. **Overall:** **PASS**

6. **Product owner feedback:** The Security card now separates the explanatory copy from the primary action with a **16px** bottom margin on the hint, matching the spacing intent for issue #83. No change to save/OTP API behaviour was observed; focus order remains paragraph then button in DOM order.

7. **URLs tested:**
   1. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/`
   2. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/login?tenant=1`
   3. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/dashboard`
   4. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/settings` (Security tab selected in automated check)
