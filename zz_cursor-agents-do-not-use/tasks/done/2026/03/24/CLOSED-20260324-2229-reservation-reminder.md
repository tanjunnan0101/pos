## Closing summary (TOP)

- **What happened:** GitHub #74 asked for reservation reminder emails to include a guest link to **update** the reservation, aligned with confirmation behaviour and public base URL rules.
- **What was done:** Reminder copy and manage URL were aligned with the existing public `/reservation?token=…` flow and `PUT /reservations/{id}/public`; HTML `href` uses safe escaping in `back/app/email_service.py`, with coverage in `back/tests/test_reservation_reminder_email.py`.
- **What was tested:** `pytest tests/test_reservation_reminder_email.py` — **2 passed**; live SMTP/inbox + browser open of the manage page were **not** run in the tester window (deferred to staging).
- **Why closed:** Tester marked overall **PASS** for automated verification; implementation and test report satisfy the task’s pass criteria for code and unit tests.

# Reservation reminder

## GitHub
- **Issue:** https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/issues/74

## Problem / goal
Reservation reminder emails should include a link so guests can **update** the reservation (not only view/cancel), matching the ask in the issue.

See **`docs/0030-reservation-confirmation-email-troubleshooting.md`** (confirmation email, `public_app_base_url`, token links) and **`docs/0024-whatsapp-reminder-notes.md`** (reminder flow: `POST /reservations/{id}/send-reminder`, email content). Align reminder template with whatever public “manage reservation” URL pattern already exists or add one if missing.

## High-level instructions for coder
- Locate the **email body/template** used for reservation **reminders** (staff-triggered send path and any scheduled reminder if present).
- Confirm how **public reservation tokens** work for view/cancel; extend or mirror that for an **update/edit** link if the product supports guest-side changes.
- Ensure the link uses the tenant’s **public base URL** configuration (same rules as confirmation email).
- Add or adjust tests or manual checklist notes so a reminder with email can be verified end-to-end (log line + inbox) without breaking existing confirmation behaviour.

## Implementation notes (coder)
- **No new URL:** Public manage page is already `/reservation?token=…` (same as confirmation). `PUT /reservations/{id}/public` supports delay notice and notes. Reminder copy was aligned with confirmation: “View or change your reservation online”, with `html.escape(..., quote=True)` on the href in `back/app/email_service.py`.
- **Tests:** `back/tests/test_reservation_reminder_email.py`.

## Testing instructions
- **Unit:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T back pytest tests/test_reservation_reminder_email.py -q`
- **Manual:** With SMTP + `PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL` set, create a **public** booking (token present), then staff **Send reminder** on that reservation. Inbox: link text should read “View or change your reservation online” and open the manage page; confirmation emails unchanged.

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC) and log window:** 2026-03-24T22:36–22:38Z approx.

2. **Environment:** `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.dev.yml`, branch `development`, commit `61e8ebc`. **`BASE_URL`:** not used for executed checks (no browser run).

3. **What was tested:** Unit tests per task; code review of reminder template strings in `email_service.py`; manual SMTP/inbox flow not executed (no configured test inbox in this run).

4. **Results:**
   - **Unit `pytest tests/test_reservation_reminder_email.py -q`:** **PASS** — `2 passed in 0.09s`.
   - **Reminder copy and manage URL in HTML/text (via tests):** **PASS** — asserts “View or change your reservation online”, full `view_url` in text, `href` matches URL, no “view or cancel” substring in HTML.
   - **HTML `href` escaping for quotes in token URL:** **PASS** — `test_reminder_href_escapes_quotes_in_url`.
   - **Manual (live send + inbox + manage page):** **NOT EXECUTED** — outbound SMTP and a real inbox were not configured for this verification; recommend staging smoke per task text.

5. **Overall:** **PASS** (automated verification complete; manual inbox step deferred to staging/PO).

6. **Product owner feedback:** Guests get the same “view or change” wording as confirmation, with safe `href` encoding. Unit tests lock the behaviour in CI; a one-off check on staging with real mail still confirms SMTP wiring and the public manage URL end-to-end.

7. **URLs tested:** N/A — no browser (manual manage-page open not run).

8. **Relevant log excerpts:** Pytest stdout: `.. [100%]` / `2 passed in 0.09s`. `pos-back` container logs in the window showed routine `/docs` traffic only; pytest does not emit through uvicorn.

**GitHub:** Comment posted on #74 at start. Label `agent:testing` may be missing in repo (same as #73).
