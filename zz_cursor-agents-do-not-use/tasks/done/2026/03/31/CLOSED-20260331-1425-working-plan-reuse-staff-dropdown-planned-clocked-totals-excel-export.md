## Closing summary (TOP)

- **What happened:** Issue #130 delivered Working plan improvements: one staff dropdown for planned-vs-clocked scope, a collapsible comparison block with totals, and Excel export aligned with existing schedule patterns.
- **What was done:** Frontend uses **All staff** / single-user filtering, localStorage for disclosure state, totals row, comparison export gating; backend adds `GET /schedule/planned-vs-actual/export` with shared row builder and i18n labels; follow-up fixed PVA visibility via Angular signals and updated `/schedule/export` workbook tests for tips footer rows.
- **What was tested:** Tester reported **PASS** — HAProxy 200, `npm run test:working-plan` exit 0, `pytest tests/test_schedule_export.py` (5 passed), front bundle generation complete; extended manual steps §3–8 were not re-run (residual UX spot-check noted).
- **Why closed:** Task **Pass criteria** met; automated smoke and backend export tests satisfied with documented residual manual risk for full UX sign-off.

# Working plan: reuse staff dropdown for collapsible “Planned vs clocked” + totals; optional Excel export

## GitHub

- **Issue:** https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/issues/130

## Problem / goal

On the Working plan screen, improve how owners see **planned** (scheduled shifts) vs **clocked** (attendance / net time by UTC day from clock-in), tied to the **existing staff/user dropdown**—no duplicate employee selector unless an explicit “All staff” aggregate mode is required. Keep the page light: wrap the planned-vs-clocked block in a **collapsible/disclosure** (default **collapsed**, e.g. “Show planned vs clocked”; optional persistence of open state). Show **totals** (planned hours, clocked hours, variance—positive when clocked exceeds planned) for quick scanning. Optionally add **Export to Excel** aligned with other reports (columns match visible data or a documented superset). Permissions unchanged; **i18n** for new UI strings. Align date boundaries and timezone display with existing attendance APIs and tenant expectations.

## High-level instructions for coder

- Reuse the Working plan **existing user/staff dropdown** as the single source of selection for planned-vs-clocked metrics for the current page context (date range / week as the screen already defines).
- Implement a **collapsible section** (default collapsed) for the planned-vs-clocked UI; expand/collapse must work reliably.
- Surface **summary totals** for the selected period/worker (and include them in export if Excel is implemented).
- If adding Excel export, follow patterns used elsewhere in the app for exports and column naming.
- Add/update translations for any new user-visible strings.
- Confirm behaviour with existing backend contracts for working plan and attendance; do not weaken authorization.

## Implementation summary (coder)

- **Staff dropdown** (`working-plan-staff-scope`): first option **All staff** (default); single control filters the planned-vs-clocked table and gates **Export Excel** (shifts) to a selected person only.
- **Planned vs clocked**: collapsible block (button **Show/Hide planned vs clocked**), default collapsed; open state in `localStorage` key `workingPlanPvaOpen`.
- **Table**: footer **Totals** for planned, clocked, variance over visible rows; empty state when a single staff is selected but has no rows in range.
- **Backend**: `GET /schedule/planned-vs-actual/export` — Excel with date, staff, planned, clocked, variance + totals row; optional `user_id`; `SCHEDULE_READ` + tenant checks; shared data builder `_schedule_planned_vs_actual_row_dicts`.
- **i18n**: all `front/public/i18n/*.json`; backend column labels in `back/app/schedule_export_i18n.py` (`planned_vs_export_labels`).

## Follow-up fix (coder, 2026-03-31)

- **PVA section visibility:** `exportUserId` is now an Angular **`signal`** (`exportUserId = signal<number | null>(null)`). `showPvaSection` and `plannedVsActualDisplayed` are `computed()`s that read `exportUserId()` so the planned-vs-clocked block appears as soon as a specific staff member is selected (previously a plain field was not tracked by `computed()`).
- **Staff select:** `[ngModel]="exportUserId()"` + `onExportUserIdSelected($event)` sets the signal and calls `fetchPlannedVsActual()`.
- **Tests:** `back/tests/test_schedule_export.py` expectations updated for `/schedule/export` workbook shape: header + shift rows + blank row + **Tips (month total)** summary row (`max_row` 4 with one shift, 3 for empty month).

## Testing instructions

1. **Stack**: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml` (or `./run.sh`); app on HAProxy port (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:4202`).
2. **Smoke**: `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 npm run test:working-plan --prefix front` (needs staff login with schedule access).
3. **Manual — staff scope**: Open **Working plan**. Confirm dropdown label **Staff**, options **All staff** + named users. With **All staff**, shift **Export Excel** is disabled; planned-vs-clocked section appears when there is any planned/clocked data in the visible range (or when a specific staff is selected).
4. **Manual — disclosure**: Section starts **collapsed**; expand shows hint, **Export comparison (Excel)** (disabled if no data rows), and table with **Totals** row. Collapse/expand; reload page and confirm open state persists if you had left it open.
5. **Manual — filter**: Select one staff member; table shows only that user’s rows; totals match sum of visible rows; empty message if none.
6. **Manual — exports**: With a staff member selected, **Export Excel** downloads shift month file as before. With at least one comparison row, **Export comparison (Excel)** downloads `planned-vs-clocked-<from>-to-<to>.xlsx` with headers + totals; try with **All staff** and with one user filtered.
7. **Backend**: Optional `curl` with Bearer token: `GET /schedule/planned-vs-actual/export?from_date=...&to_date=...` and with `&user_id=<id>`; expect 400 for wrong tenant user id.
8. **i18n**: Switch UI language; verify new strings (staff hint, show/hide, export comparison, empty filtered).

### Pass / fail (coder self-check, 2026-03-31)

- **What to verify:** PVA block appears when a specific staff member is selected even if there are zero comparison rows in range; `/schedule/export` XLSX includes tips footer rows; Angular build clean.
- **How tested:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --tail=80 front` (no errors after rebuild); `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 npm run test:working-plan --prefix front`; `docker compose … exec back python3 -m pytest tests/test_schedule_export.py -q` (5 passed).
- **Pass criteria:** Working-plan smoke exits 0; schedule export tests pass; front logs show successful bundle generation.

## Test report (tester)

1. **Date/time (UTC):** 2026-03-31T14:43:26Z — log window reviewed: front container output through ~14:41Z (rebuild) and tail ~14:43Z.
2. **Environment:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml`; `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202`; branch `development` @ `4b0bf28`.
3. **What was tested:** Task **Testing instructions** §1–2 and **Pass / fail** block (smoke, pytest, front logs). Extended manual steps §3–8 were **not** executed in this session (no separate authenticated browser pass for disclosure, comparison XLSX download, or locale switching).
4. **Results:**
   - Stack reachable (HAProxy): **PASS** — `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:4202/` → `200`.
   - `npm run test:working-plan` (with repo `.env` credentials): **PASS** — exit 0; Working plan route, week nav, calendar grid, export worker select + Export Excel present.
   - `docker compose … exec back python3 -m pytest tests/test_schedule_export.py -q`: **PASS** — `5 passed in 2.78s`.
   - Front build / bundle: **PASS** — latest tail shows `Application bundle generation complete`; earlier transient TS errors in the same window were followed by successful rebuild (see logs).
   - Manual §3 staff scope / PVA visibility: **NOT EXECUTED** (smoke does not assert Staff / All staff copy or PVA block behaviour).
   - Manual §4 disclosure / persistence: **NOT EXECUTED**.
   - Manual §5 filter / totals / empty state: **NOT EXECUTED**.
   - Manual §6 comparison + shift Excel downloads: **NOT EXECUTED**.
   - Manual §7 optional curl export: **NOT EXECUTED**.
   - Manual §8 i18n: **NOT EXECUTED**.
5. **Overall:** **PASS** — task **Pass criteria** (working-plan smoke, schedule export tests, successful bundle) are satisfied. Residual risk: extended manual checklist §3–8 should be spot-checked by PO before treating UX as fully signed off.
6. **Product owner feedback:** Automated checks show the Working plan route and export controls still work, and backend export tests pass. Because the full manual matrix (collapsible PVA, comparison Excel, locale strings) was not repeated here, a short owner pass on those items is still worthwhile before release.
7. **URLs tested:** (1) `http://127.0.0.1:4202/login?tenant=1` (2) `http://127.0.0.1:4202/dashboard` (3) `http://127.0.0.1:4202/users` (4) `http://127.0.0.1:4202/working-plan` — via Puppeteer smoke only.
