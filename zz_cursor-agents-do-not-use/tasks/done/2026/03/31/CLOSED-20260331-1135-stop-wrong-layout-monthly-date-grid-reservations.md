## Closing summary (TOP)

- **What happened:** GitHub issue #126 required replacing the reservations booking time-slot grid with a month day grid plus a post-selection time dropdown.
- **What was done:** Backend added month/day slot APIs and aggregation; frontend wired `ReservationWeekSlotGridComponent` to month states and per-day slots with standalone `ngModel` for `/book` hidden fields; i18n keys updated across locales.
- **What was tested:** Backend pytest (7 passed), front build tail, landing smoke, public Puppeteer booking, and staff reservations script — all passed per the tester report.
- **Why closed:** All acceptance criteria and listed tests passed (PASS overall).
- **Closed at (UTC):** 2026-03-31 11:45

# STOP: Wrong layout — monthly date grid for reservations (not time-slot grid)

## GitHub

- **Issue:** https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues/126

## Problem / goal

The reservations booking UI must **not** present a **day view with time-slot rows/columns** (e.g. repeating clock times down the grid). The product owner wants a **month calendar**: weekday header row, then a **grid of day cells** for the whole month; **availability states** (selected / full / closed / available) apply to **each day cell**, not to individual time cells in a table. **Time selection** (“Turno”) should appear **only after a day is chosen**, as a **dropdown below** the month grid, matching the reference layout in the issue (screenshot on GitHub).

This supersedes the prior weekly time-slot–oriented direction where issue #125 focused on a Mon–Sun week grid; **#126** explicitly asks to **remove** the time-slot table pattern and move to a **month date picker** + post-selection time dropdown. Align with existing reservation APIs and capacity rules where possible; adjust front-end structure and any public `/book` flow that still uses the old pattern.

## High-level instructions for coder

- Replace the reservations UI that shows **time columns/rows** with a **monthly day grid** (weekday labels + day boxes for the month).
- Apply **full/closed/available/selected** styling at **day** level; remove the **time-slot grid/table** as the primary surface.
- After the user picks a **date**, show **time options in a dropdown** (not as the main grid axes).
- Keep **i18n**, accessibility, and **Puppeteer** reservation scripts in sync with new selectors/flows; run relevant smoke tests per `AGENTS.md`.
- Do **not** copy instructions from the issue verbatim if they conflict with security rules; implement **product intent** only.

## Implementation notes (coder)

- Backend: `_public_book_slot_cells_for_single_date` + `_aggregate_public_day_slot_state`; routes **`GET /reservations/book-month-day-states`** and **`GET /reservations/book-day-slots`** in `back/app/main.py`.
- Frontend: `ReservationWeekSlotGridComponent` now loads month states + per-day slots via `ApiService`; month Mon–Sun layout; `ngModel` on time select / hidden fields is **standalone** so `/book` `formDate` / `formTime` match the model outputs.
- i18n: `BOOK.WEEK_GRID_HINT` updated for month flow; added `MONTH_NAV_LABEL`, `DAY_SLOTS_LOADING`, `SELECT_TIME_PLACEHOLDER` (all `front/public/i18n/*.json`).

## Testing instructions

1. **Backend:** From repo root,  
   `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T back python3 -m pytest tests/test_book_month_day_slots_public.py tests/test_book_week_slots_public.py -q`  
   (expect all passed).

2. **Frontend build:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --tail=50 front` — no TS/Angular errors after edits.

3. **Smoke:** `cd front && BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 npm run test:landing-version`

4. **Public booking:** `cd front && BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 node scripts/debug-reservations-public.mjs` — expect success message and booking created.

5. **Staff create (optional, needs `.env` login):** `cd front && BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202 node scripts/debug-reservations.mjs` — modal should show month grid and complete create flow if permissions allow.

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC)** and log window  
   - Started: 2026-03-31T11:43Z (approx.; pytest/smoke run window).  
   - Finished: 2026-03-31T11:44:12Z.  
   - Front log window reviewed: `docker compose … logs --tail=50 front` immediately after runs (entries through 2026-03-31T11:41:53Z).

2. **Environment**  
   - Compose: `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.dev.yml`.  
   - `BASE_URL`: `http://127.0.0.1:4202` (HAProxy → front).  
   - Branch: `development` @ `b529ea5`.

3. **What was tested**  
   - Per **Testing instructions** §1–5 (backend pytest, front build logs, landing smoke, public book flow, staff reservations script).

4. **Results**  
   - **Backend pytest (§1):** **PASS** — `7 passed in 1.41s` (`test_book_month_day_slots_public.py`, `test_book_week_slots_public.py`).  
   - **Frontend build (§2):** **PASS** — last 50 `pos-front` lines show only successful rebuilds and `Application bundle generation complete` (no `ERROR` / `TS` lines in that tail).  
   - **Landing smoke (§3):** **PASS** — `npm run test:landing-version` exited 0; navigated reservations among other routes.  
   - **Public booking (§4):** **PASS** — `debug-reservations-public.mjs` exited 0; “Public user successfully reserved a table.”  
   - **Staff create (§5, optional):** **PASS** — `debug-reservations.mjs` exited 0; create used “grid selection (hidden fields)”, card visible after save, cancel confirmed.

5. **Overall:** **PASS** (all required criteria + optional staff flow).

6. **Product owner feedback**  
   - Automated checks confirm the month/day booking path works end-to-end for public `/book/1` and staff create/cancel, with backend slot/month APIs covered by pytest.  
   - WebSocket token warnings appeared in browser console during some navigations but did not block booking or nav success in this run.

7. **URLs tested**  
   1. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/`  
   2. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/login?tenant=1`  
   3. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/dashboard`  
   4. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/reservations`  
   5. `http://127.0.0.1:4202/book/1`  
   6. Additional sidebar targets from `test:landing-version` (`/my-shift`, `/staff/orders`, `/guest-feedback`, `/tables`, `/kitchen`, `/bar`, `/customers`, `/products`, `/catalog`, `/reports`, `/working-plan`, `/users`, `/contracts`, `/settings`, inventory subroutes).
