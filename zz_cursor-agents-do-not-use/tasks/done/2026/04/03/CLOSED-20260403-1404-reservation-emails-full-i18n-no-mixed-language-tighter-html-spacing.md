## Closing summary (TOP)

- **What happened:** Tester handed off this CLOSED task after verifying the reservation email i18n and spacing work tied to GitHub issue #163.
- **What was done:** Implementation covered localized confirmation/reminder strings via `get_message`, prepayment placeholder rules without duplicate wording, tighter HTML spacing in the server-built path, migration **20260403150000**, and extended pytest coverage for **en** / **es** per the task brief.
- **What was tested:** Migrate reported up to date at **20260403150000**; **22** pytest tests passed for `test_reservation_email_template.py` and `test_reservation_reminder_email.py`; optional manual Spanish SMTP/inbox check was not run (N/A per tester).
- **Why closed:** Required automated verification passed; overall test report **PASS**.

# Reservation emails: full i18n, no mixed language, tighter HTML spacing

## GitHub Issues

- Optional: `--json number,title,labels,updatedAt,url`
- **Issue:** https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/issues/163

## Problem / goal
Reservation confirmation emails must use **one** language end-to-end: derive language from tenant `default_language` (normalized), and if the reservation model already stores a booking locale, **prefer that** when sending.

All server-built strings in the confirmation path (prepayment line, arrival note, map link labels, contact block, and any remaining literals) should go through **`get_message(..., lang)`** with keys added for **all shipped locales** in `messages.py`.

Avoid redundant prepayment wording: `DEFAULT_BODY` and tenant-authored templates must not stack **`{{prepayment_notice}}`** and **`{{prepayment_text}}`** in a duplicate way—document the intended combination in code/comments.

Reduce excessive vertical whitespace: collapse extra blank lines before HTML conversion and/or post-process repeated `<br>` in the confirmation fragment so default templates are tighter.

Do **not** auto-correct tenant policy typos; optional Settings hint copy only if product wants it.

Add or extend tests so rendered output is asserted for at least **en** and **es**.

See **`docs/0030-reservation-confirmation-email-troubleshooting.md`** (and related reservation/email docs under **`docs/`**) if they describe current behavior.

## High-level instructions for coder
- Audit **`back/app/reservation_email_template.py`**, **`back/app/email_service.py`**, and any helpers used when building confirmation (and reminder if the issue scope implies shared fragments); list every hard-coded English string and replace with **`get_message`** keys.
- Add missing message keys across **`back/app`** locale tables / `messages.py` for every language the product ships.
- Implement prepayment placeholder rules without duplicate prepay text; update comments and any template hints for tenant custom bodies.
- Tighten HTML spacing (blank lines / repeated breaks) in the server-built confirmation path; verify HTML + plain-text parts still read well in clients.
- Extend **`tests/test_reservation_email_template.py`** (and reminder tests if touched) for **en** and **es** snapshots or substring assertions on localized fragments.
- Run targeted pytest per **`AGENTS.md`**; optional manual SMTP check with a real test inbox (not `@example.com`).

## Testing instructions

1. **Migrate:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec back python3 -m app.migrate` (expect version **20260403150000**).
2. **Pytest:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec back python3 -m pytest tests/test_reservation_email_template.py tests/test_reservation_reminder_email.py -q`
3. **Manual (optional):** Create a public booking with `?lang=es` (or `Accept-Language: es`) and a customer email; confirm the received confirmation is Spanish end-to-end (subject, labels, button, footer). Staff-created bookings use the request language captured in **`locale`**; reminders use the same **`reservation_transactional_lang`** path when **`send_reservation_reminder`** runs.

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC) and log window:** 2026-04-03 14:08–14:10 UTC (migrate + pytest in `pos-back` container).

2. **Environment:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml`; branch **development** @ **f76de49**; no browser / no `BASE_URL` smoke (backend-only verification).

3. **What was tested:** Task **Testing instructions** items 1–2 (migrate expected version; targeted pytest). Item 3 (manual Spanish booking + inbox) **not** run — marked optional in task.

4. **Results:**
   - **Migrate to 20260403150000:** **PASS** — `app.migrate` reported max applied **20260403150000** and “Database is up to date”.
   - **`tests/test_reservation_email_template.py` + `tests/test_reservation_reminder_email.py`:** **PASS** — `22 passed in 0.27s`.
   - **Manual Spanish end-to-end email:** **N/A (optional, not executed)** — no SMTP/inbox check in this run.

5. **Overall:** **PASS** (required automated checks satisfied).

6. **Product owner feedback:** Reservation email template and reminder tests pass in Docker with the current schema, including localized assertions covered by the suite. Optional real-inbox verification for Spanish public booking was skipped; run that if you want end-to-end mail client confirmation beyond pytest.

7. **URLs tested:** **N/A — no browser** (API/pytest only).

8. **Relevant log excerpts:**
