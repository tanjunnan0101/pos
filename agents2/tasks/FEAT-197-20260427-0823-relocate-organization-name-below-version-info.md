# Relocate Organization Name below Version Info

## GitHub Issues

- **Issue:** https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues/197
- **197**

## Problem / goal

The organization name does not fit well beside the main “POS” title. Move it to its own line **below** the version line (version + commit hash), keep visual hierarchy clear, and preserve long-name safety (ellipsis / overflow).

## High-level instructions for coder

- Revert the `.logo` span content to display only **POS** (no org name in that span).
- Add a dedicated element (e.g. `div`/`span`) **below** the `.version` block inside the logo/header area for the organization name (see issue for suggested structure).
- Style that org row: smaller than version text (e.g. ~11px or slightly below version size), muted color, optional max-width with `text-overflow: ellipsis` and `overflow: hidden` for very long names.
- Touch only the landing/header components and styles involved (follow existing patterns from the recent organization-name work if present in history/docs).
