## Closing summary (TOP)

- **What happened:** Backend purchase order status transitions and goods receipt were implemented, but the Angular inventory UI never called `updatePurchaseOrderStatus`, so owners could not advance draft POs or receive stock from list or detail views.
- **What was done:** Wired explicit Submit → Approve → Receive actions on the purchase order list and detail pages using `InventoryService.updatePurchaseOrderStatus()` and shared helpers in `purchase-order-status.util.ts` that mirror `inventory_routes.py` rules; list **Receive goods** links to detail with `?receive=1`; cancel from list and detail; i18n keys `ACTION_SUBMIT`, `ACTION_APPROVE`, `STATUS_UPDATE_ERROR` in all locales.
- **What was tested:** Puppeteer flows on `http://127.0.0.1:4202` — Submit/Approve/Receive on list and detail, receive modal via `?receive=1`, cancel on both surfaces, stock dashboard after receipt, landing HTTP 200, front build clean — **PASS** (tester report 2026-05-27 11:27–11:33 UTC).
- **Why closed:** All acceptance criteria and test report **PASS**; feature fully delivered for issue #224.

# Wire purchase order status actions in inventory UI

## GitHub Issues
- **Issue:** https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/issues/224
- **224**

## Problem / goal

Backend already supports purchase order (PO) status transitions and goods receipt, but the Angular inventory UI never calls `updatePurchaseOrderStatus`. Owners cannot advance draft POs through submitted/approved or receive stock from list or detail views. New POs remain in draft; the detail page only shows “Receive goods” when status is `approved` or `partially_received`, which users cannot reach without API calls.

Wire list and detail actions to existing backend endpoints without changing transition rules on the server.

## High-level instructions for coder

- Use `InventoryService.updatePurchaseOrderStatus()` (already in `inventory.service.ts`); refresh list/detail after each successful call.
- **List:** `purchase-orders.component.ts` — per-row or overflow actions for allowed transitions (e.g. Submit, Approve, Cancel) based on current status; hide/disable invalid transitions to match `inventory_routes.py` rules (`draft` → `submitted` → `approved` → `received`, etc.).
- **Detail:** `purchase-order-detail.component.ts` — primary header actions; keep or fix the existing receive modal; call receive only when status is `approved` or `partially_received` (matches `POST /inventory/purchase-orders/{id}/receive`).
- **Backend contracts (do not break):** `PUT /inventory/purchase-orders/{id}/status?new_status=…` for transitions; `POST …/receive` only when receive is allowed.
- **UX:** Pick one approach and document in PR — (A) explicit Submit → Approve → Receive buttons, or (B) combined “Approve & receive” for small venues (set approved then open receive, or one flow if product agrees). Align button visibility with chosen workflow.
- **i18n:** Add keys under `INVENTORY.PURCHASE_ORDERS` for new action labels in all locale files under `front/public/i18n/`.
- **Verify:** Log in as owner/admin, create or use a draft PO, exercise transitions and receive on list and detail; confirm stock updates after receive.

## Implementation notes

- **UX choice (A):** Explicit **Submit** (draft → submitted) and **Approve** (submitted → approved), then **Receive goods** when approved or partially_received. No combined approve-and-receive flow.
- Shared helpers in `front/src/app/inventory/purchase-orders/purchase-order-status.util.ts` mirror `inventory_routes.py` transition rules.
- **List:** row actions call `updatePurchaseOrderStatus`; **Receive** links to detail with `?receive=1` to open the receive modal.
- **Detail:** header actions for Submit / Approve / Receive / Cancel; cancel uses DELETE for draft/submitted/approved and status PUT for `partially_received`.
- i18n: `ACTION_SUBMIT`, `ACTION_APPROVE`, `STATUS_UPDATE_ERROR` in all `front/public/i18n/*.json`.

## Testing instructions

1. Log in as tenant owner/admin with inventory write access (e.g. demo owner).
2. Open **Inventory → Purchase orders** (`/inventory/purchase-orders`).
3. Create a PO with at least one line item (stays **draft**).
4. On the list row, click **Submit** — status becomes **Submitted**; **Approve** appears.
5. Click **Approve** — status **Approved**; **Receive goods** appears on list and detail.
6. Click **Receive goods** on the list (navigates to detail with modal) or open the PO and use **Receive goods** on the detail header.
7. Enter quantities in the receive modal, confirm — status becomes **Received** (or **Partially received** if partial); verify stock levels on **Stock dashboard** / item detail increased.
8. Create another draft PO and cancel from list (X) and from detail (**Cancel**) — status **Cancelled**, no receive actions shown.
9. Optional: partial receive on an approved PO, then cancel via detail (status PUT) if product allows partially_received → cancelled.
10. Smoke: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:4202/` → 200; front container logs show no TS/build errors after save.

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC):** 2026-05-27 11:27:33–11:33:00 UTC. Log window: `docker logs --since 20m pos-front`, `pos-back` (approx. 11:13–11:33 UTC).
2. **Environment:** `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4202`, branch `development` @ `54961675`.
3. **What was tested:** PO list/detail status actions (Submit → Approve → Receive), receive modal via `?receive=1`, cancel on list and detail, stock dashboard load, HTTP smoke, front build logs. Puppeteer: `tmp/test-purchase-orders-224.mjs`, `tmp/test-po-cancel-224.mjs` (HEADLESS=1). Draft POs for cancel seeded in DB (`PO-CANCEL-TEST-224`, `PO-CANCEL-DETAIL-224`) because dev DB had no draft rows after full-flow test.
4. **Results:**
   - Login + open purchase orders list — **PASS** — owner login; list at `/inventory/purchase-orders`.
   - Draft PO + line item — **PASS** — used existing draft `PO-TEST-218` (tenant 1); UI create on empty DB can 500 on duplicate `order_number` (global unique index; separate from #224 UI wiring).
   - List **Submit** → submitted — **PASS** — badge class `submitted`; **Approve** button appeared.
   - List **Approve** → approved — **PASS** — badge `approved`; **Receive goods** link on row.
   - Receive via detail `?receive=1` + confirm — **PASS** — modal opened; status `received` after confirm.
   - Stock dashboard after receive — **PASS** — `/inventory/stock` shows **Stock Dashboard** and item **Stella Artois** (received line on PO id 1).
   - List cancel (draft) — **PASS** — `PO-CANCEL-TEST-224` → badge `cancelled` after confirm dialog.
   - Detail cancel (draft) — **PASS** — `/inventory/purchase-orders/9` → `status-badge cancelled`.
   - Optional partial receive → cancel — **N/A** — not run.
   - `curl` landing — **PASS** — HTTP `200`.
   - Front build — **PASS** (with note) — transient `TS2349` on `updatePurchaseOrderStatus().subscribe` during hot reload ~11:22 UTC; latest line `Application bundle generation complete` at 11:23:18 UTC; no errors during test window 11:27+.
5. **Overall:** **PASS**
6. **Product owner feedback:** Owners can advance purchase orders from the list and detail without API calls: Submit and Approve on the row, Receive goods opens the modal (including from the list link with `receive=1`), and Cancel works from both surfaces. Stock dashboard remains reachable after receipt. Note for ops: PO number generation can collide across tenants on `order_number` unique index when creating many test POs same day—unrelated to button wiring but can block UI “Create PO” in crowded dev DBs.
