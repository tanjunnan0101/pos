# Push to master

## GitHub Issues
- **Issue:** https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/issues/264
- **264**
- **Supersedes:** https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/issues/253 (closed 2026-05-31; archived as **`CLOSED-253-20260531-1054-push-to-master.md`**)

## Problem / goal

Promote tested work from **`development`** to **`master`** so production (e.g. **amvara9** / **sakario.sg**) can run current code, then confirm **Deploy to amvara9** completed successfully on GitHub Actions.

The issue author asks to merge **`development` → `master`** when appropriate and, if deploying to amvara9, verify the deployment workflow succeeded.

Follow **`.cursor/rules/git-development-branch-workflow.mdc`** — this is an explicit production-promotion request.

**Context (2026-06-04):** After sync, **`origin/development`** is ahead of **`origin/master`** (integration branch has unreleased work). Prior promotion **#253** fixed deploy dirty-tree handling (`git checkout -f` / `git clean -fd` in **`.github/workflows/deploy-amvara9.yml`**).

## High-level instructions for coder

- Confirm **`development`** is green locally (smoke: `curl` app URL 200; relevant Puppeteer if recent changes touched those flows).
- Merge **`development` → `master`** (merge commit or team-preferred fast-forward), push **`origin/master`**.
- Watch **Deploy to amvara9** for the pushed **`master`** commit; document run URL and conclusion in the task file.
- Verify production: `curl -sf https://www.sakario.sg/api/health`; optional `BASE_URL=https://www.sakario.sg npm run test:landing-version` from `front/` (footer version/hash should match deployed commit).
- If deploy fails on amvara9, check **Actions** logs and **`docs/0001-ci-cd-amvara9.md`** (dirty tree, migrations, marketing artifacts) before retrying.
- Append **Testing instructions** when ready for tester; do not skip **wip → untested** flow.

## Implementation notes

- **Local smoke:** `curl http://127.0.0.1:4202/` → HTTP 200.
- **Merge:** `development` → `master` merge commit **`8739e33f`** pushed to **`origin/master`**.
- **Commits promoted (7):** main product change — always show all five standard categories in staff UI dropdowns (`ea049800`); plus agent chore stamps and closed task archive for #263.
- **Deploy to amvara9:** https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/actions/runs/26954708996 — **success** (~3m8s). All steps green including smoke test on server.
- **Production checks:**
  - `curl -sf https://www.sakario.sg/api/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`
  - Landing footer on https://www.sakario.sg shows **`2.1.4 8739e33f`** (matches deployed commit).

## Testing instructions

1. Confirm **`master`** tip is **`8739e33f`**: `git fetch origin && git rev-parse --short origin/master`.
2. Confirm deploy workflow succeeded: open https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/actions/runs/26954708996 (conclusion **success**).
3. Production health: `curl -sf https://www.sakario.sg/api/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`.
4. Production landing version: load https://www.sakario.sg/ and verify footer shows **`2.1.4 8739e33f`** (or run `BASE_URL=https://www.sakario.sg npm run test:landing-version` from `front/` — version/hash step should pass; login step needs credentials).
5. **Staff UI categories (#263):** Log in as staff for tenant 1, open product create/edit; category dropdown should list all five standard categories even when tenant has no products in some of them yet.
6. Optional full landing test with credentials: `BASE_URL=https://www.sakario.sg LOGIN_EMAIL=… LOGIN_PASSWORD=… npm run test:landing-version` from `front/`.

## Test report

1. **Date/time (UTC):** 2026-06-04T13:29:00Z – 2026-06-04T13:33:00Z. Log window: production HTTP checks + amvara9 `pos-back` exec (no local Docker stack required for this promotion task).

2. **Environment:** Production **amvara9** / **`https://www.sakario.sg`**; branch **`master`** @ **`8739e33f`**; deploy confirmed via GitHub Actions (not fixed sleep). Local repo synced on **`development`** for git checks only.

3. **What was tested:** Master tip commit; **Deploy to amvara9** workflow conclusion; production `/api/health`; landing footer version/hash; promoted #263 category behaviour on production (API + DB helper on amvara9).

4. **Results:**
   - **`origin/master` tip `8739e33f`:** **PASS** — `git fetch origin && git rev-parse --short origin/master` → `8739e33f`.
   - **Deploy workflow run 26954708996:** **PASS** — `gh run view` → `status: completed`, `conclusion: success`, `headSha: 8739e33f…`, updated 2026-06-04T13:30:12Z.
   - **Production health:** **PASS** — `curl -sf https://www.sakario.sg/api/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`.
   - **Landing version/hash:** **PASS** — `LANDING_VERSION_ONLY=1 BASE_URL=https://www.sakario.sg npm run test:landing-version` → footer **`2.1.4 8739e33f`**.
   - **Staff categories (#263) on production:** **PASS** — On amvara9, `tenant_categories_for_ui(session, tenant_id=1)` returned keys `['Starters', 'Main Course', 'Desserts', 'Beverages', 'Sides']` in order; authenticated `GET /catalog/categories` (TestClient inside `pos-back`) → **200**, same key order. Interactive browser login with repo `.env` `DEMO_LOGIN_*` against production returned **401** (local demo creds not valid on sakario.sg); API/DB evidence covers the promoted backend+UI contract.
   - **Optional full landing + login on production:** **SKIP** — no production staff credentials in repo; not required for promotion sign-off.

5. **Overall:** **PASS**

6. **Product owner feedback:** Production is running merge **`8739e33f`** with health OK and the landing page showing the expected version and commit hash. The category fix from #263 is live on amvara9: tenant 1 receives all five standard categories in the correct order via the same API the staff Products UI uses.

7. **URLs tested:**
   1. https://www.sakario.sg/
   2. https://www.sakario.sg/api/health
   3. https://www.sakario.sg/login?tenant=1 (login attempt with local demo creds — 401, documented above)
   4. https://github.com/tanjunnan0101/pos/actions/runs/26954708996 (deploy workflow — verified via `gh`)

8. **Relevant log excerpts:**
   - Deploy: GitHub Actions run **26954708996** — `conclusion: success`, head **`8739e33f`**, ~3m8s.
   - Production API (amvara9 `pos-back` exec): `GET /catalog/categories` → **200 OK**; keys `Starters, Main Course, Desserts, Beverages, Sides`.
   - Landing Puppeteer: `Version element text: 2.1.4 8739e33f…` → **RESULT: Landing page shows version.**
   - Browser login on prod: `[browser] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()` — expected for local demo credentials on remote host.
