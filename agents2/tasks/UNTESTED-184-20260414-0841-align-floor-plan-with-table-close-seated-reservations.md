# Align floor plan status with table close: finish seated reservations on POST /tables/{id}/close

## GitHub Issues

## Problem / goal
Staff closing a table from the tile grid clears the table session (`is_active`, order fields), but **GET /tables/with-status** can still show the table as **occupied** because it treats a **seated** reservation on that `table_id` as a busy state. The tile list uses **GET /tables** while the floor plan canvas uses **GET /tables/with-status**, so “closed” and “green/occupied” disagree and confuse staff.

**Expected:** Closing a table should end the service cycle for any **seated** reservation on that table (unless product policy explicitly requires otherwise), so **operational_status** matches staff expectation—typically back to available (or reserved if a future booking still applies).

## High-level instructions for coder
- In **POST /tables/{table_id}/close** (`close_table`): after existing session cleanup (and empty-order deletion if present), find reservation(s) for this tenant/table with status **seated** and transition them to **finished** (or the project’s equivalent terminal state).
- Reuse the same logic and side effects as the existing “finish reservation” / status-update path (notifications, clearing `seated_at`, invariants)—prefer calling a shared helper or internal use of existing finish logic to avoid duplication.
- Add or extend **tests**: close table when a seated reservation exists on that table → reservation ends in finished (or equivalent) → **GET /tables/with-status** shows non-occupied for that table when no other blocking state (active kitchen order, etc.) applies.
- **Optional:** After successful close in the tile client, refetch **getTablesWithStatus** where shared state needs it, or document navigation behavior; larger alternative is aligning the tiles view to **/tables/with-status** for parity (only if product wants that scope).

## Implementation summary
- Added `_mark_reservation_finished()` in `back/app/main.py` and use it from `PUT /reservations/{id}/finish`, `PUT /reservations/{id}/status` (finished), and **`POST /tables/{table_id}/close`**.
- `close_table` now loads tenant-scoped **seated** reservations for that `table_id`, marks them finished (clears `table_id` / `seated_at`), commits with the table session cleanup, then emits **`reservation_finished`** WebSocket updates (same payload shape as finish endpoint) before **`table_closed`**.
- New test: `back/tests/test_close_table_finishes_seated_reservation.py`.

## Testing instructions
1. From repo root with dev stack up:  
   `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T back python3 -m pytest tests/test_close_table_finishes_seated_reservation.py -q`
2. Manual: seat a reservation on a table, close the table from the staff tile flow, confirm floor plan (**GET /tables/with-status**) shows **available** for that table when there is no active order and no other seated reservation.
